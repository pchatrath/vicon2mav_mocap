# vicon2mav_mocap
connects to the Vicon Data Stream, sends out att_pos_mocap MavLink messages

I used the Qt creator to write the source code and build the application. As this was created as a Qt project, I would recommend doing the same.

I know the source code is poorly documented, I will do this eventually when I've some time left.
