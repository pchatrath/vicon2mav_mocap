# vicon2mav_mocap (v2m)

### What v2m does:
It connects to the Vicon Datastream over a network, graps the relevant data, edits it according to the att\_pos\_mocap MavLink message and sends the message out to a TCP/IP sever.

**TLDR**: Vicon Datastream in, att_pos_mocap MavLink message out.

### How to use v2m, how to get it running:
1. What libraries are needed:
	* the ViconDataStreamSDK, espially the *client.h* and the *libViconDataStreamSDK_CPP.so*
	* the MavLink library (found here : https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink)
	* a TCP/IP server which can forward information unaltered to a serial port (I use [ser2net](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ser2net/))

2. Before building and using:
	* I included ...
		* *client.h* [here](https://github.com/moskytoo/vicon2mav_mocap/blob/master/main.cpp#L26)
		* *libViconDataStreamSDK_CPP.so* in the .pro file of my Qt project
		* *mavlink.h* [here](https://github.com/moskytoo/vicon2mav_mocap/blob/master/main.cpp#L30)
	* Setting the constants: Constants concerning your system are set in *functions.h*. In the *main.cpp* are four constants, which decide in which 'mode' v2m should run.
	* 
		 
	

I used the Qt creator to write the source code and build the application. As this was created as a Qt project, I would recommend doing the same.

I know the source code is poorly documented, I will do this eventually when I've some time left.
